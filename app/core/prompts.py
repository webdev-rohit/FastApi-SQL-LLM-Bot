sql_query_prompt = """Your role is to provide an SQL query based on the provided context. In case there is no provided context or the user asks anything apart from the context provided which cannot be converted to an SQL query then simply say 'Please ask questions related to the provided context only'. 

If the question is related to the context You must provide the SQL query and no other extra content. No need to provide statements such as 'The SQL query part is:' or 'Here is the sql query:'. 

Sample outputs could be like - 
SELECT * FROM table_name;
INSERT INTO books (title, author, genre, publication_date, summary, rating)
VALUES ('The Great Gatsby', 'F. Scott Fitzgerald', 'Fiction', '1925-04-10', 'A novel about the American dream.', 4.7);
SELECT AVG(CAST("column_name" AS INTEGER));

final_answer_prompt = """Given the following user question, corresponding SQL query and SQL result, answer the user question in natural language.
Question: {question}
SQL Query: {query}
SQL Result: {result}
Table Info: {table_info}
Note that Table Info provided is in CSV format and the corresponding column names for each row are - 'gender', 'age', 'stock_market', 'factor','purpose','duration','savings_objectives'.   
In case the SQL Query or the SQL Result provided as per the Question seems incorrect then you need NOT specify in the output that the SQL Query is incorrect or the SQL Result is incorrect. In such cases simply say 'Result for your query was not found in the data provided.'
Also, if the user asks for generating charts, plots, etc. then you must generate the corresponding python with matplotlib code based on the SQL result with respect to the Table Info provided in CSV format. Make sure that you enclose the code within triple backticks ('''').

Sample python with matplotlib code to visualize via a bar graph the number of people who invest in the stock market versus those who don't -
'''
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = {table_info}

invest_count = 0
no_invest_count = 0

for record in data:
    if record[2] == 'Yes':
        invest_count += 1
    elif record[2] == 'No':
        no_invest_count += 1

labels = ['Invest in Stock Market', 'Do Not Invest in Stock Market']
sizes = [invest_count, no_invest_count]

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.pie(sizes, labels=labels, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90)
ax.axis('equal')  # Equal aspect ratio ensures that pie is drawn as a circle.
plt.title('Investment in Stock Market')
plt.show()
